<h1>Interpolations</h1>

  Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into marked up text. By default,
  interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ "{{" }} and {{"}}"}} as
  delimiters.

<h1>Property Bindings</h1>
<small>
  Property binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML
  elements or directives. Use property binding to do things such as toggle
  button functionality, set paths programmatically, and share values between
  components.

<button [disabled]="isButtonDisabled">Some button</button>

<br />

<img [src]="imageSource" [alt]="imageAlt" />

  keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and touches.
